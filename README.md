# Data Structures & Algorithms

This is a complement to the post work material and should be used as such, listed here are a collection of additonal readings and questions to further your learning of Data Sturctures and Algorithms.

These resources are widely available online and have been collected here to make it easier to study and to help narrow down what you should start working on.

There are over 100 questions in this [List](https://leetcode.com/list/5r99deem) for you to practice 

If you make it through all of the questions do the following to get added to the completionists!
- make a fork of this repo
- take a screenshot of the todo percentage on Leetcode for this list of questions showing that you have solved all of the questions.
- on your fork add your name and github handle to the completionists doc
- push your local fork up to your remote fork and submit a pull request to the main repo
- on your pull request add the photo of your 100% finished list to the comments of the Pull Request (PR's without photo will not be added to the doc)
- Submit the PR
